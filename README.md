### Intro
I'll preface this repository with a small introduction, I'm studying Computer Programming at Georgian College in Barrie, ON. This repository will contain all of my work and examples from the professor as well as possibly other sources (including my own work) on topics pertaining to PHP, the LAMP (WAMP) stack, and MYSQL. 

### Tech

Throughout the course I'll be using the WAMP stack with these tools:

- [PHP Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/ "PHP Storm")
- [MYSQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/ "MYSQL Workbench")
- [WAMP Server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/ "WAMP Server")
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ "Azure")
